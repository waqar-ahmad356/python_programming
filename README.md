<h3> Python identation</h3>
<p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
</p>
<h3>Python variables</h3>
<p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
<strong>Casting :</strong> If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Variables Names: A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
</p>
<p>Assign Multiple Values : Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line
Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.</p>
<p>Output Variables: The Python print() function is often used to output variables.</p>
<p>Global Variables: Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
Global keyword: To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.</p>
